# BasicHTML

For this mini-project, the goal was to get familiar with HTML as I progress through my career as a computer science major and potential web developer. The three main concepts that I've learned here are how to make a bare-bone homepage, a way to link to another page using "href" or "Hypertext REFerence," and a simple registration page. 

At the Georgia Institute of Technology, I've already had exposure to basic HTML formattings such as Ordered Lists, Unordered List, and headers from an Intro to Computing class (CS1301). Furthermore, I've used what I've learned, refined, and extended my knowledge using Sublime Text. Some of the new things that I've learned are how to use a href, the difference between relative and absolute path, the concept of self-closing tags, and much more.

Below, I'll provide pictures to the 3 HTML sites that I've created as well as explanation to the code that I've created.

## Home page (Included CSS text color and background)

## Home page (index.html)

In the index.html file, I've commented on my learning process and shown the technical side of the coding process. The overarching theme that I've learned from index.html is that every HTML file needs the following tags below.

## New page (newpage.html)

One of the most significant features of Html is its ability to link to other pages or documents. In our everyday lives, we use this feature every single day.
An anchor tag has an attribute called href, also known as the hypertext reference, which links to other pages.

## Register page (register.html)

Within the form tag, we must specify specific elements such as input with a type (usually a text). I've done this for first and last name, email, and password in the code above. Furthermore, the br tag (break tag) is essential visually to make sure everything lines up nicely. The overarching theme in the register.html is to play around with different types of inputs that HTML has available.
